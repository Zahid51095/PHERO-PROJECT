    <p class="text-xl font-medium">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</p>
    <p>var: Scoped to the function or global context.
        Gets hoisted (moved to the top) within its scope, so it can be accessed before it's declared.
        Can lead to unexpected behaviors due to hoisting and wider scope.</p>
    <p>let: Scoped to the block (curly braces) it's in, like an if statement or loop.
        Doesn't get hoisted, so it can only be accessed after it's declared.
        Safer and more predictable for most cases, especially in modern JavaScript.</p>
    <p>const: Also scoped to the block it's in, just like let.
        Like let, doesn't get hoisted and can only be accessed after it's declared.
        Must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned afterwards.
        Ideal for values that won't change, making your code more readable and less error-prone.</p>
    <p>In short, prefer using let and const due to their clearer scoping rules and avoidance of common pitfalls
        associated with var. Use const when you want to keep a value constant, and use let for variables that can change
        their value.</p>



    <p class="text-xl font-medium">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</p>
    <p>Undefined- Indicates an uninitialized variable, an absent value, or the default return value of a function with
        no explicit return.</p>
    <p>Use cases: Declared variables without values, missing function arguments, checking property existence.</p>
    <p>Null: Explicitly represents an empty or no-value state, often set by the programmer.</p>
    <p>Use cases: Assigning no value to a variable, indicating absence in objects or APIs, representing emptiness
        intentionally.</p>


    <p class="text-xl font-medium">3.What do you mean by REST API?</p>
    <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized way for software
        applications to communicate over the internet. It follows a set of rules and conventions that allow clients and
        servers to exchange data using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It's commonly used in web
        development to create web services and enable different applications to interact with each other.</p>
